## 1. Project Overview

## Project Title

### Smart Utilities Management System

Mission

To streamline the management of utilities (gas, water, and electricity) by providing companies with a comprehensive overview of their client base and individual consumption patterns.

Description

Developed as a full-stack application, this software facilitates the recording and monitoring of utility data for clients. The fictitious company, Smart Utilities, can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on client data and their respective utility readings.



## 2. Technical Architecture

### REST API Architecture

The application adheres to REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### Key Characteristics of REST:

**1 Statelessness**: Each request from the client must contain all the information needed to process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests, enhancing scalability and reliability.

**2. Client-Server Architecture**: Separates the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, allowing the client and server to evolve independently.

**3. Uniform Interface**: Defines a standardized way of communicating between client and server, simplifying and decoupling the architecture.

**4. Layered System**: The architecture can be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior, enhancing scalability and manageability.

**5. Cacheability**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data.

**6. Code on Demand (Optional)**: Servers can extend client functionality by transferring executable code.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
